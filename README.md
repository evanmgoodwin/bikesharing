## Introduction

What is the population of Des Moines. What are it's demographics? What does it's tourism industry look like? How popular is biking within and around the city? These are the questions we will answer today, and those answers will show you why investing in a bike-share business in Des Moines is a worthy investment.

## User Type

In New York city alone, there almost 2.5 million rides taken using the citi-bike rental bikes. This number represents roughly 30% of the city's population. Assuming simlilar demand, the number of rides taken in Des Moines over the same time period could be well over 65,000. Also, the city's population has been increasing steadily over the past several decades.

## Age

As we can see from the citi bike data, the majority of users, both subscribers and one off customers, were born between the years 1980 and 2000. This key demographic is crucial to the success of the business in Des Moines. The median age in Des Moines, as it happens, is 34. This makes Des Moines an ideal location with an ideal demand waiting for the supply. As a note, the spike in customer bar graph is most likely an anamoly, or perhaps even an error in the data.

## Gender

We can see from the numbers that males represent the greatest percentage of users in New York city. This is true even knowing that the male population of the city makes up only 47.4% of the total. Males in Des Moines, on the other hand, make up 49.2% of the city's population, a number higher than the national average. 

## Subscribers vs Customers

While subscribers make up more than 75% of the users in New York, we can see from the chart on the right showing the total trip duration breakdown by user type, that customers represent a major portion of trips, and should not be discounted. Its also safe to assume that a lot of one-time customers are tourists. The tourism industry in Des Moines, as we will see in a bit, is substantial.

## NYC Locations

Our maps of starting and ending locations show us the most popular borough for bike rentals is Manhattan. Manhattan also happens to be the most popular for tourism.

## Tourism

Des Moines has had a booming tourism industry for the past decade. It is the capital of the state of Iowa, has it's own baseball team (the Iowa Cubs) and has a number of popular tourist attractions.

## Downtown Des Moines

The city of Des Moines has been touted as a popular destination for cyclists of all types. The city has an intricate series of bike lanes, used by commuters and tourists alike. The abundance of available bike lanes in downtown makes the city an ideal location for bike-sharing business.

## Biking Trails

Downtown is not the only place cyclists may frequent; there is also a robust network of biking trails that spread out from the city into more rural areas. With one of the most complex system of trails in the midwest, the area has been a popular biking destination, and its popularity continues to grow. Placing bike stations outside of the city would allow users the option to take a one-way ride without worrying about have to return their bikes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Des Moines is an ideal city for a bike rental business. The age and gender demographics are perfect for us to replicate the success in New York. The public infrastructure is in place to support potential users. The demand already exists, in the form of commuters, tourists, or anyone else who wants to take a ride.
